# TeaLang Compiler

## Project Summary

This project focuses on building a compiler for the **TeaLang** programming language based on **EBNF grammar**. The compiler consists of several key stages: lexical analysis, parsing, AST construction, XML generation, semantic analysis, and interpretation.

In the second phase, the compiler was extended into **Tea2Lang**, introducing new features and enhancements to the original implementation.
